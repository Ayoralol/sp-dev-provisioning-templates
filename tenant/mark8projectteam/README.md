# Mark8 Project Team

Using Planner and PowerBi along with other project-related web parts, this team site is all about the project -- from planning and progress, to tracking results.  

## Template content

Template contains following structures and assets:

- Complex welcome page with out-of-the-box web parts
- Example images and Office documents

**Notice** - If applied on top of existing communication site, welcome page content will be overridden.

## Full layout

Below picture shows the expected layout from this template.

**Note** - There might be small differences between the screenshot from the [SharePoint look book](https://spdesign.azurewebsites.net) and the end results of the template. Template automation will get you as close as possible given certain API level limitations. Templates are also designed to be as independent as possible, which has resulted some compromises on the implementation.

## Prerequisites

- You will need to be a site collection administrator to be able to deploy this solution with permissions to create new site collections, unless you apply it on top of an existing site
