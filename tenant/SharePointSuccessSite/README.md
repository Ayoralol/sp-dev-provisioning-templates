Use the SharePoint Success Site to:

- **Get more out of SharePoint** - Teach new site owners how to utilize the power behind SharePoint's communication and collaboration features.
- **Enable site owners to create high-impact sites** - Ensure site owners have the right information and support to create purposeful sites that are widely adopted by the intended audience.
- **Ensure site owners follow site creation policies** - Customize the site creation policy page on your SharePoint Success site to communicate organizational policy expectations early.
- **Provide the most up-to-date content** - Equip site owners with SharePoint self-help content that is maintained by Microsoft and published as SharePoint evolves.
