# Product Support

This team site is a great resource for your team that supports customers. It includes information on product releases, documents with customer scripts, and charts to visually track metrics. 

## Template content

Template contains following structures and assets:

- Custom welcome page with out-of-the-bob web parts
- Custom list with view formatting definition
- Sample images and Office documents

**Notice** - If applied on top of existing communication site, welcome page content will be overridden.

## Full layout

**Note** - There might be small differences between the screenshot from the [SharePoint look book](https://spdesign.azurewebsites.net) and the end results of the template. Template automation will get you as close as possible given certain API level limitations. Templates are also designed to be as independent as possible, which has resulted some compromises on the implementation.
