# Microsoft 365 learning pathways

Help your organization get more from Microsoft services by implementing Microsoft 365 learning pathways. This digital, customizable, learning solution streams on-demand content for Microsoft 365 services to users in an organization. The convenient playlist format allows employees to improve their skills on their timetable and at their pace. The modern SharePoint Online site also allows you to add your own content to create a complete, modern, training portal.

Microsoft 365 learning pathways is the new name for the solution formerly known as Custom Learning for Office 365. If you have already provisioned Custom Learning for Office 365 in your organization and want to update the solution, follow the “Updating the solution” instructions in the [Microsoft 365 learning pathways ReadMe](https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365).
