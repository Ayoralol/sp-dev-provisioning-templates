# SharePoint Syntex content center

## Content intelligence for everyone!
  
Use this site to learn more about SharePoint Syntex. We’ll introduce you to the tools you’ll need to create and train your own models. You can then use this site as a central content repository or as the control center for managing your own SharePoint Syntex models.

Models can be trained and evaluated using your own content. However, to apply the models to libraries, a license for SharePoint Syntex is required.
